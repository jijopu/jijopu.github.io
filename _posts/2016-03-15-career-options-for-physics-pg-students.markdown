#Opportunities ahead

Many students who take up higher studies in physics are often unaware of the various opportunities that await them. Even if they do, they find it difficult to surmount such barriers as national level competitions. Many a times it is their lack of basic undestanding of the subject, and in other cases their lack of prepartion that prevent them from scoring well in such exams. In order to soar high, bulding a sound knowledge of the basics is advisable.

Discussed below are several tangible opportunities achievable with a single devoted preparation for a masters degree student in physics, and in certain cases for bright bachelors degree students, as well. Even though there are a wide variety of options for success before a physics graduate who has the twin potential of mathematical reasoning ability and applied practical skills, we will focuss on a few exclusive options for physicists.

Being competitive in the job market means good understanding of the subject as well as thorough prepartion for specific examinations. We will discuss a few exams that test your competence and further pave way for a good career in the subject through research and development. If you are looking for employment right away after graduation, every employer will test your abilities in the following areas:

Verbal Abilities
Quantitative Aptitude
Qualitative Aptitude
General Awareness
To measure your ablities in these areas, various examinations, written and oral, will be designed. They invariably have the following structure:

–      Reading

–      Comprehension

–      Analysis

–      Writing

–      Speaking (Personal Inverview).

Physics postgraduates can pursue their career in various government owned Scientific Research and Development Organizations such as Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), Physical Research Laboratory Ahmedabad, Nuclear Science Centre New Delhi, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics Kolkata, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Several other government organizations are also offering various jobs for these graduates. Some of those organizations:

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC),
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL),
National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).
We will discuss a few competitive exams that will launch your professional career in physics, either in academia or in research. If you can reach the level of competency to qualify any one of these, others in the list are also within your reach.
